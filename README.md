# Police's Phonecase Hub

College project for Advanced Java Frameworks, with a goal to develop a web-app that consumes a microservice to collect, store, and display data
for polices and their phonecases.

# About 

The broader scope of this project is to practice and demonstrate our skills in building and consumping APIs while integrating a responsive front-end style.
More specifically, the use of SpringBoot RESTful Web Services, Angular routing, and Bootstrap CSS designing. The goal of the app is to create and display lists of pre-stored police & phonecase entities
which has the following features: *Register a Police*, *Display Lists of Police*, *Register a Phonecase*, and *Display lists of Phonecase*

NOTE: When registering a phonecase, user has the ability to select an existing police from the database.
